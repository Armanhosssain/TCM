					5 Common Laptop Problems and How to Repair Them
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					A huge chunk of the corporate world is mobile, and they need computing power that can accommodate that. Over the years laptops have gone from bulky and heavy to slim and lightweight. But, even with all the upgrades in power, size, capacity and memory, laptop problems still arise pretty regularly. Here is a quick list of five of the most common problems we hear about and how you can address them on your own.

          1.Problem: Loud fan or heating up followed by shut down. Laptops get moved around a lot. This can lead to limiting air intake to the fan. It also gives them plenty of opportunities to drag dust and foreign particles into their cooling system via their fan portal

      <div class="card-body">
       Solution: Use your laptop on hard, flat surfaces; Avoid putting it on soft surfaces that may block air passage. Clean out your fan with compressed air. Limit how many programs you run at once as well because the more you have running, the harder it has to work.

          2.Problem: Battery doesn’t last. One of the best features of a laptop is that it’s wireless. But, we live in constant fear of draining our battery and running out of juice, so we are constantly hard on our battery.

    <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="card-body">
        Solution: First, check all of your charger cable connections to be sure they are snug. Next, drain your battery completely and recharge it by leaving your laptop on until it dies. One of the greatest fixes of all technology is simply to fully drain the energy from it and try again, the computer equivalent of a good night’s sleep. If it still fails far sooner than it should, you may need to replace the battery itself.

          3.Problem: No internet. Laptops are notorious for losing connection to the internet, which can be a major hassle. Before assuming some sort of equipment failure, try some basic steps.

      <div class="card-body">
        Solution: On most laptops, there is an actual wireless button or switch to activate the connection, find it and make sure it’s in the ON position. Then re-boot your router, again using the drain the power tactic; unplug your router, let all the juice drain out for 10-20 seconds, then plug it back in. If you’re still having trouble, troubleshoot your network connections in your control panel. Finally, re-build your network from the beginning to make sure all your connections are set up properly..

       Solution: There are lots of ways to try to tackle speed issues, but check out our blog post dedicated to just this topic for 10 tips on speeding up your machine.
       <ol>
       	<li>
       		 <b>Reduce Items that Run on Startup</b>

If your computer takes a long time to start up, the first thing you want to do is see everything it starts when you hit the power button.

To do this, click on the Windows button, click “run,” and then type “msconfig” into the box. Click on the “Startup” tab. Some things you want to leave alone. For example, your Antivirus. Others, such as Adobe Acrobat or Google Toolbar Notifier, you don’t need to startup with your computer.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b>Remove Programs No Longer In Use</b>

Along with preventing every app on your computer from starting with Windows, you should also review which programs you no longer need and remove them.

Access the uninstaller tool from your control panel and use that to uninstall programs you don’t use. I regularly do this, of course, as a software reviewer.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b>Clean Your Drive</b>

Clean up your drives by typing “cleanmgr.exe” into the run menu to access Disk Cleanup. This is that “search programs and files” box that shows when you hit the Windows Start icon, usually in the lower left of most screens (although you can move it to any part of the screen).
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b>Consider Switching From Internet Explorer to Chrome</b>

If you are using Internet Explorer (IE) as your Web browser, it is time to upgrade. Make the Google Chrome download the last thing you do on it.

Chrome is faster and has fewer bugs than IE 11. (Sorry, IE users.)
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b>Clean Your Browser</b>

Regardless of your browser, you should clean it out regularly. To clean Chrome, click the three bars icon in the upper right corner, then click “Tools,” then “Clean Browsing Data,” and then check the history boxes, cookies and cached items.

Or, download CCleaner which does a great job on the five top browsers, registries and Windows, overall.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		 <b>Scan For And Remove Malware</b>

Anything that starts with “mal” must be stopped. You should regularly scan your system to get rid of any malware that may be slowing your computer down.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b> Scan For And Remove Viruses and Spyware</b>

In addition to performing regular scans on your computer for malware, you should also regularly scan for viruses and spyware.

Access your antivirus and manually perform a scan. You can schedule these weekly. Just make sure you do so when you won’t be using the computer. Also, having more than one antivirus on your computer will slow it down, so unless you are wanting to be incredibly thorough, and perhaps a bit redundant, it is better to run only one.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b>Make Adjustments For Better Performance</b>

If you want better performance and don’t mind losing visual effects such as mouse shadows, click on “computer,” and then “system properties,” and then “advanced system settings.” You will find a performance settings button that allows you to select “adjust for best performance.”

You can also reduce your screen resolution, which can speed things slightly and improve battery life when running on it.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		<b> Defrag Your Drive</b>

You should defragment your drive or schedule it to perform this action automatically. In general, you can do this monthly. However, if you excessively download, move, uninstall, or install programs, you may need to do it more frequently.

If your computer is running slow, you can manually analyze the disk to see if it is more than 10% fragmented. I still do this occasionally, but Windows seems to be doing a better job of keeping things optimized.
       	</li>
       	<li>
       		 <b>Add More RAM Memory</b>

There are a few physical things you can do to increase your performance, as well. You can and should add more RAM memory until the computer is at capacity. I’ve found that as a machine ages, you can extend its utility with a RAM upgrade. I’m literally ordering RAM for one of my laptops as I write this.

In most cases, this is simply a matter of snapping in or out memory sticks. Laptops are usually slightly more tricky and you have to remove screws, but still fairly easy. You can also have a retail store service desk do it.
